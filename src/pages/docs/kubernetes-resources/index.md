# Kubernetes Resources

Gimlet abstracts away the use of Kubernetes. As much as we'd like to make issues resolvable on Gimlet's UI, it's not unexpected that you'll need outside-of-Gimlet troubleshooting one day. For this reason, you can find a comprehensive guide about getting started and fixing the most common issues when it comes to Kubernetes.

If all else fails, feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ZwQDxPkYzE).

In this section, you'll find these resources:

- **Kubernetes Essentials**
	- How to get started with Kubernetes and some basic commands.
- **Troubleshooting**
	- Self-service guide for the most common Kubernetes errors and solving them.
- **Gimlet Manifest Reference**
	- Documentation for the manifest files Gimlet creates for applications deployed with it.
