  There are many ways to configure deployment settings with Gimlet. You can easily add HTTPS and social authentication to your application.
---

## [Container Image Settings](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/image-settings)

Container Image Settings describes how you can set up an application for deployment, whether it has an image already available, or if it still needs to be built from code or using a Dockerfile.

## [Registries](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/image-settings)

Any OCI compatible container registries can be added to Gimlet.

## [Social Authentication](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/social-authentication)

You can configure and add social authentication with your deployed apps. Email and GitHub authentication is supported currently with more in progress.

## [Port Forwarding](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/port-forwarding)

Create port forward commands for your deployed applications.

## [DNS](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/dns)

Configure DNS settings to make applications available on custom domains.

## [HTTPS](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/https)

Add HTTPS certificates with cert-manager to secure connection to deployed applications.

## Deployment Configuration

Define deep-level configuration settings with Gimlet's UI instead of tinkering YAML files.

## [Secrets](/src/pages/docs/deployment-settings/secrets)

Manage and seal secrets for referenced use in your code base with the help of Bitnami's Sealed Secrets.

## Infrastructure Management

Connect and delete environments to Gimlet. Specify environment variables for custom configuration.
