# ONCE/BUSL

We considered our options, and decided that $300 is the most optimal price tag for our tool.

For organizations, it's a budget-friendly price tag compared to the value it offers. Organizations burn substantially more money on the daily developing their in-house solutions, while Gimlet is designed to provide off-the-shelf hosting experience ready to support the most common use cases of software deployments.

For us, it's money, which we can use to deliver new features, host Gimlet for you and provide support when needed.

## How does ONCE work?

The Gimlet flavor of ONCE has one-time annual payments. This means that you'll get access to every new feature we publish in the 12 months after your purchase.

You'll start with a 7-day trial to evaluate if Gimlet is helpful for you, and if we live up to our promise of delivering the best deployment experience.

Your license will expire a year after your purchase.

On the technical level, you'll start off with an ephemeral infrastructure provided by us for the trial period and can't connect any real clusters until you purchase the license.

After your purchase, your instance will be moved to a permanent infrastructure, and you can connect new environments to your Gimlet.

If you decide to not purchase Gimlet, all of your data, including git repository connections, deployed applications, and so on, will be removed and won't be recoverable after the trial.

## Why BUSL?

Business Use License (BUSL) allows us to monetize commercial use of Gimlet and leave the door open for free usage to individuals and non-profits if they decide to self-host.
